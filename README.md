# mqsieventcollector
An simple collector of IBM mqsi events.

# Pre requisites 

## WebSphere MQ
You will need a local installation of WebSphere MQ and that the 
environment variable "MQ_JAVA_LIB_DIR" is set.

## Gradle
The project is built using Gradle. As long as you have a JRE on your path you can actually use the 
bundled gradle wrapper instead (gradlew on Linux or gradlew.bat on Windows). It will download an embedded
gradle jar-file and run so you don't need to install anything.
